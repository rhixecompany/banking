# URL Extraction

Extract content from: $ARGUMENTS

## Command

```bash
parallel-cli extract "$ARGUMENTS" --json
```

Options if needed:

- `--objective "focus area"` to focus on specific content

## Response format

Return content as:

**[Page Title](URL)**

Then the extracted content verbatim, with these rules:

- Keep content verbatim - do not paraphrase or summarize
- Parse lists exhaustively - extract EVERY numbered/bulleted item
- Strip only obvious noise: nav menus, footers, ads
- Preserve all facts, names, numbers, dates, quotes

## If `parallel-cli` is not found

If the command fails with "command not found", **stop immediately**. Do NOT fetch the URL yourself, do NOT use any built-in fetch tools, and do NOT try to summarize the page from your own knowledge. Instead, tell the user:

1. `parallel-cli` is not installed
2. Run `/parallel-setup` to install it
3. Then retry their extraction
